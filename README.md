# document_aggregator
This is a project to improve my skill and familiarity with AWS.  It is a serverless web scraper and a serverless web page that displays the data collected by the web scraper.

## Notes
Consider using something from https://tfhub.dev/s?module-type=text-generation 
with TF Serving to handle document summerization.
